-CTC - Office
    Someone tells the trains what needs to be done and then the software decides how to use this.
    Dispatcher uses CTC
    Based on dispatcher's suggestions the CTC sends speed and authority to wayside controller.
        speed and authority are just suggestions. System can decide that the suggustion is unsafe.
        Speed: how fast the train goes.

-Wayside controller - Programmable Logic Controller(PLC)
    Switches and lights are controlled.
        Lights could be green or red.
        Relays will move switches and set light color.
    All this PLC knows how to do is execute boolean logic.
    Will decide based on occupancy which way switches are going and lights are lit.

-Track Model
    Model of track and all its parts: tunnels, track, hills, stations, passengers embarking.
    Separated into blocks:
    Tells Occupancy

-Train Model
    Models physics of train.
    Given a power command will calculate what the velocity of the train is.
    Operates facilities on the train: Lights, doors, temperature control.
    Tracks passengers disembarking.

-Train controller.
    Calculates the power command, Takes velocity to and from train model.
    It calculates this from speed.
    It gets speed from train model which gets it from track model which gets in from wayside controller.
    Train controller is "vital". Regulating the speed. You get to use floating point arithmetic.
    You need to stop the train.
    2 kinds of brakes: service and emergency.
